# Lists ADT
+ Lists are ordered, meaning the position of the item MATTERS and is persistent.
+ Typically, a new entry being added will be added to the end, but lists should also contain the ability to insert at any position of the list
+ Lists should allow you to remove an item
+ You should be able to remove ALL items
+ You have the ability to replace an item
+ you can look at any entry
+ You can count the number of items
+ You can look at ALL items
+ You can see if a list is empty

some more things to consider:
What if we use toArray on an empty list? How should we handle it?
+ We could return an empty array
+ We could throw an exception
